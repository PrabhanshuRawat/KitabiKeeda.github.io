                    Cosmos has 13 heavily illustrated chapters, corresponding to the 13 episodes of the Cosmos
                    television
                    series. In the book, Sagan explores 15 billion years of cosmic evolution and the development of
                    science
                    and civilization. Cosmos traces the origins of knowledge and the scientific method, mixing science
                    and
                    philosophy, and speculates to the future of science.

                <p>Rich Dad Poor Dad is Robert's story of growing up with two dads — his real father and the father of
                    his best friend, his "rich dad" — and the ways in which both men shaped his thoughts about money and
                    investing. The book explodes the myth that you need to earn a high income to be rich and explains
                    the difference between working for money and having your money work for you.</p>

                <p>It is not my purpose to attempt a real autobiography. I simply want to tell the story of my numerous
                    experiments with truth, and as my life consists of nothing but those experiments, it is true that
                    the story will take the shape of an autobiography.
