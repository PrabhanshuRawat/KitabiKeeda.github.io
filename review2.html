                <p>In this magnificent book, K talks about the true purpose of education and how the current educational
                    system is in urgent need of a revolution. The true purpose of education is to provide students an
                    environment that is not driven by fear, sets them free to investigate, inquire, rather than
                    conforming them into a pattern so that they do not revolt against society or discover anything new.
